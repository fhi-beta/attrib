# Attrib

Attrib is designed to make the process of calculating attributable mortalities and incident risk ratios effieciant and easy. 
The package is based on generating simulations making it easy to aggregate all data from for example county to national levels or weekly to seasonal levels without loosing information about credible intervals on the way.
